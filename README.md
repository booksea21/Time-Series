**Time Series Practices**

-Visualization and decomposition (trend, seasonality, residuals)

-Stationarity testing using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test

-Data transformations (log, differencing) to induce stationarity

-ACF/PACF analysis for ARIMA model selection

-ARIMA/SARIMA model implementation and diagnostics

-Forecasting and evaluation using RMSE and MAPE and so on.
